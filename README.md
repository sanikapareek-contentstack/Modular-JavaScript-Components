<h1>Modular JavaScript Components</h1>
<h3>Creating reusable counter and timer components.</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Counter and timer components are designed using DOM manipulation.</li>
<li>render() function is used to design the HTML. It returns "div" element which contains the whole component.</li>
<li>mount() function is used to mount the component at the desired place. It takes the element where the component needs to be mounted as the input.</li>
<li>A unique ID generation function is created so that each instance can work independently.</li>
<li>Bind function is used so that the object calling the function becomes this and not the element (like button) calling the function becomes this.</li>
</ul>
